URGENT: Fix Core Registration and Membership System

My CBA (Croydon Business Association) members application has critical system failures that need immediate fixing. Based on comprehensive backend analysis, here are the specific issues and required solutions:

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PROBLEMS TO FIX

1. QR Code Generation Failure

â€¢
Issue: Only 6% of members have QR codes (24 out of 432 members)

â€¢
Root Cause: QR code generation not triggering during registration

â€¢
Required Fix: Ensure QR codes are automatically generated for ALL new registrations

2. Membership Tier Assignment Broken

â€¢
Issue: All membership tiers show 0 members despite having 432 total members

â€¢
Root Cause: Membership tier assignment logic not working

â€¢
Required Fix: Implement automatic tier assignment during registration

3. Event Registration System Failure

â€¢
Issue: All events show "No registrations yet" - members cannot register for events

â€¢
Root Cause: Event booking workflow broken

â€¢
Required Fix: Enable member event registration functionality

ðŸŽ¯ SPECIFIC FIXES REQUIRED

A. Registration Workflow Fixes

Plain Text

- Update existing 432 members to have appropriate tiers


2. QR Code Generation:

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Database Updates Needed:

SQL


-- Add membership tier to existing users
UPDATE users SET membership_tier = 'Community' WHERE member_type = 'resident' AND membership_tier IS NULL;
UPDATE users SET membership_tier = 'Business Starter' WHERE member_type = 'business_owner' AND membership_tier IS NULL;

-- Add district field for residents
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN district VARCHAR(255);


QR Code System:

Plain Text


- Ensure QR generation service is called during registration
- QR codes should contain unique member identifier
- QR scanner should successfully lookup members
- Fix "Attendee Not Found" errors in scanner


Event System:

Plain Text


- Fix event registration API endpoints
- Enable member event booking
- Connect bookings to QR-based check-in system
- Test complete flow: Register â†’ Book Event â†’ QR Check-in


âœ… VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After implementing fixes, verify:

All 432 members have QR codes generated




QR scanner can find all members



3.
Event Registration Test:




Members can register for AI Summit 2025

Admin dashboard metrics

â€¢
User account creation (432 members)

â€¢
