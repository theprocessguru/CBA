---

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Missing CSRF Protection
**Location:** Entire application  
**File:** No CSRF middleware implementation found  
**Description:** The application lacks CSRF token validation for state-changing operations. While session cookies have `httpOnly: true` and `sameSite: 'lax'` settings, there is no explicit CSRF middleware or token validation.  
**Impact:** Attackers can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users through cross-site request forgery attacks.  
**Recommended Fix:** Implement CSRF middleware (like `csurf`) and require CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE).

### 2. Disabled Rate Limiting on API Endpoints  
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` line 273  
**Code:** `// app.use('/api', limiter); // Disabled rate limiting to fix auth issues`  
**Description:** General rate limiting for API endpoints is commented out and disabled.  
**Impact:** APIs are vulnerable to brute force attacks, DoS attacks, and automated abuse.  
**Recommended Fix:** Re-enable rate limiting with proper configuration that doesn't interfere with authentication.

### 3. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 4901-4926, 4973-4991  
**Description:** Direct SQL queries using template literals without parameterization:
```typescript
const pendingApprovalsResult = await db.execute(sql`
  SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
  FROM cba_event_registrations 
  WHERE registration_status = 'pending'
`);
```
**Impact:** Potential SQL injection if user input is incorporated into these queries.  
**Recommended Fix:** Use parameterized queries or Drizzle ORM's query builder consistently.

### 4. Weak Session Security Configuration
**Location:** `server/localAuth.ts` lines 39-45  
**Code:**
```typescript
cookie: {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: false, // False for HTTP
  sameSite: 'lax', // Lax for same-site
  maxAge: sessionTtl,
  path: '/',
}
```
**Description:** Session cookies have `secure: false`, allowing transmission over unencrypted HTTP.  
**Impact:** Session cookies can be intercepted in transit on non-HTTPS connections.  
**Recommended Fix:** Set `secure: true` and enforce HTTPS throughout the application.

### 5. Excessive Password Reset Token Validity
**Location:** `server/localAuth.ts` line 405  
**Code:** `const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // 7 days`  
**Description:** Password reset tokens are valid for 7 days, which is excessively long.  
**Impact:** Extended window for attackers to exploit compromised reset links.  
**Recommended Fix:** Reduce token validity to 1-2 hours maximum.

### 6. Potential Password Hash Exposure
**Location:** `server/localAuth.ts`, `server/routes.ts`  
**Description:** User objects returned in API responses may include `passwordHash` field if not properly filtered.  
**Impact:** Exposure of bcrypt password hashes in API responses.  
**Recommended Fix:** Always exclude sensitive fields (passwordHash, etc.) when returning user data in API responses.

### 7. Weak Password Policy
**Location:** `server/localAuth.ts` lines 113-115, 456-458  
**Code:** 
```typescript
if (password.length < 8) { // Registration
if (password.length < 6) { // Reset
```
**Description:** Inconsistent and weak password requirements (8 chars for registration, 6 for reset).  
**Impact:** Weak passwords are easier to crack through brute force.  
**Recommended Fix:** Enforce consistent minimum 12-character passwords with complexity requirements.

### 8. Admin Authorization Bypass Risk
**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 200-223  
**Description:** The `isAdmin` middleware logs show `undefined` values for `isAdmin` property in some cases, indicating potential bypass vulnerabilities.  
**Impact:** Non-admin users might gain administrative access.  
**Recommended Fix:** Ensure consistent admin status verification and fail closed when undefined.

### 9. Development Credentials in Code
**Location:** `server/localAuth.ts` line 437  
**Code:** Development mode exposes reset URLs with tokens  
**Description:** Reset tokens are exposed in development responses.  
**Impact:** Sensitive tokens could be logged or exposed in non-production environments.  
**Recommended Fix:** Remove all development-specific credential exposures.

### 10. Session Fixation Vulnerability
**Location:** `server/localAuth.ts`  
**Description:** Sessions are not regenerated after successful login.  
**Impact:** Attackers can fixate session IDs before victim authentication.  
**Recommended Fix:** Call `req.session.regenerate()` after successful authentication.

### 11. Insecure Direct Object References
**Location:** Multiple endpoints in `server/routes.ts`  
**Description:** User IDs are directly used in URLs without proper authorization checks in some endpoints.  
**Impact:** Users might access or modify other users' data.  
**Recommended Fix:** Always verify ownership/permission before allowing access to resources.

### 12. Missing Security Headers
**Location:** `server/index.ts`  
**Description:** While helmet is used, CSP is weakened for Stripe integration and other security headers may be missing.  
**Impact:** Reduced defense against XSS, clickjacking, and other client-side attacks.  
**Recommended Fix:** Review and strengthen all security headers.
